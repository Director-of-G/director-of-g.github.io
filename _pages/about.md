I am Yongpeng Jiang (姜永鹏), a second-year PhD student in the [Intelligent Manipulation Lab](https://thu-irml.com), Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiang Li](https://sites.google.com/view/homepageoflixiang/home).

Currently my research focuses on dexterous manipulation under rich contacts, especially with multi-fingered hands. It's an honor to have been working with [Mingrui Yu](https://mingrui-yu.github.io/) in dexterous manipulation and deformable objects manipulation, and with [Xiangjie Yan](https://yanseim.github.io/) in human-robot collaboration. They are people of great ability and enthusiasm.
